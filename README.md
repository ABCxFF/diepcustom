## Running backend

Run the server with:
```bash
$ npm run server
```
This builds and runs the server.

After running the server, content will be served at `localhost:8080` on your computer. The port will default to 8080, and you may override it with `process.env.PORT`.

Consult `src/config.ts` for configuration, and `package.json` for environ variable setup.

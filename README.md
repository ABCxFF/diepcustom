## Installation

You may need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), as well as the [Yarn Package Manager](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).\
After doing so, download or clone this repository and install the dependencies with:
```bash
$ yarn install
```

## Running the Server

Run the server with:
```bash
$ yarn run server
```
This builds and runs the server.

After running the server, content will be served at `localhost:PORT` on your computer. The port will default to 8080, and you may override it with `process.env.PORT`.

Consult `src/config.ts` for configuration, and `package.json` for environ variable setup.
